# js-workshop

Repository for the JavaScript workshop example. It implements a simple cookie
clicker game in vanilla JavaScript.

## Usage

Run `./serve.sh`, and if the web browser doesn't open automatically, open
`http://localhost:5150` in your browser.

## Recommendation

I recommend either having Deno installed or getting it in the Nix shell.
This will supply you with Deno's language server and Prettier for formatting
the HTML and CSS files.
